BPNet is a full-connected multilayer network which uses stochastic gradient descent based back propagation algorithm for optimization. It can be used for classification or regression tasks. This project contains the following file : 

+ pdf / BPNet.pdf :  a pdf of where I mainly untilize the Jacobia matrix for mathematical derivation of BPNet. 
+ code / BPNet.py :  a python code implementation based on numpy library. Coding is also according to the derivation of BPNet.pdf. 
+ code / test.py :  a python code for testing BPNet.py on minist data set. 
+ data : a folder which contains four csv file : minist_images_train.csv, minist_label_train.csv, minist_images_test.csv, minist_labels_test.csv. 
+ trainParameters:  a folders which contains a pre-trained parameters.

Now I am trying to make some difference in this readme file, for I want to explore how github work.

2022.6.21, VolcanoX adds this text line. 2022.6.21, VolcanoX adds this text line. 2022.6.21, VolcanoX adds this text line. 2022.6.21, VolcanoX adds this text line. 

Try it again! Commit!

Here I add this line via VS Code built-in Git. And I push this revise from my local computer to github.
